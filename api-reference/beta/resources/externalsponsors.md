# externalSponsors complex type

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Used in the approval stage of an [access package assignment policy](accesspackageassignmentpolicy.md). 
It is a subtype of [userSet](userset.md), in which the `@odata.type` value `#microsoft.graph.externalSponsors` indicates that a requesting user's connected organization external sponsors are to be the approver. This approver is only applicable to requests from users who are part of a connected organization.  When creating an access package assignment policy approval stage with externalSponsors, also include another approver, such as a single user or group member, in case the connected organization does not have an external sponsor.
